Afterwards for starting the development server make sure that you are in the root of the project(SurgeAssigment) and then type

```
docker-compose up
```

The default port of the nodejs application is `8090`.
The default port of the reactjs application is `3000`.
The default port of the mongo db is `27017`.

Now everything is fine and your application will run smoothly !!!!

If you want to seed a dummy admin to your database go to backend folder then type

```
npm run seed
```

If it fails to connect database then go to your backend container

```
docker exec -it <backend container id> bash
```

You can find your backend container id by typing

```
docker ps
```


Then run npm run seed inside it it will seed one admin to database

```
npm run seed
```
(Once the seeding is success  dont run the npm run seed code again)


Admin email = `admin@gmail.com`
Admin Password = `Admin1234`

If you want exit from docker container type 

```
exit
```

Now you can log in using above admin credentials.


If you want to run backend unit testing go to backend folder and type 

```
npm test
```
(If it doesn't run go inside the backend container and type above command)


If you want to run frontend unit testing go to frontend folder and type 

```
npm test
```
(If it doesn't run go inside the frontend container and type above command)

(I was unable to complete the unit testing part before the deadline because  I'm still learning the unit testing on mern.But I added one unit case for frontend and one for backend with my current knowledge)

If you want to stop running project type 

```
docker kill <backend-container-id> <fronted-container-id> <mongodb-container-id>
```
